Bottom Navigation App allows user to move between different fragments. This app was created using Java

A bottom navigation menu is a common design pattern in Android application development. It allows users to navigate between multiple screens or fragments within an app.
In an Android Activity or Fragment, you can create a bottom navigation menu by using the Navigation component or a third-party library such as BottomNavigationView.
The Navigation component provides features like efficient navigation and automatic handling of back button presses. When designing a bottom navigation menu, consider factors like icon size, color, and layout to ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-use experience for your app users.
